## 5 Adding the App Store Widgets {#add-appstore-widgets}

You can add App Store widgets to your app by downloading them directly in the **Widgets** tab in the Web Modeler. These widgets are a subset of all widgets available in the app store: you can only download the ones that are approved for use in the Web Modeler. You can also update them if an update is available. For more information on managing widgets in your app, see [App Settings in the Web Modeler](app-settings-wm). 

To add an App Store widget, do the following:

1. Open the **Widgets** tab.

2. Do one of the following: 

    a. Find the category with the **View App Store widgets** option and click it. <!-- Don't really understand what this does -->

    b.  Start typing the name of the category or of a specific widget in the **Search** field.

3.  Click the cloud icon to download the widget and add it to your project.

The widget is now added to your project, you can simply drag and drop it to the page to use it.

You can also view settings of this widget in the **App Settings**.  For more information, see [App Settings Overview in the Web Modeler](app-settings-wm).

Some App Store widgets <!-- perhaps this is a naming problem: what you actually download from the App Store is a module. That module can contain widgets, but it could also just be microflows or domain models --> are downloaded as a package consisting of several widgets, for example, when you download one chart widget, the whole package of charts is downloaded.
